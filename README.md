# RespEst
Repository of Rinta &amp; Yuki's research int TKG.

## Introduction

Hello! I'm jj1lis, high school student in Japan.
This is a tool reads context in the text and judges Emotion-Polarity, and is being developed for research in school with my friend.
"RespEst" is abbreviation of "Response Estimation." At first we wanted to do it and to use it for adversing. However it's difficult for us to do suddenly. So we tried to do this first.

## Required Environment

RespEst requires at least the following environment:

- Python 3.x
- CaboCha 0.60 or higher

CaboCha will require the following. This is general env.

- CRF++ 0.55 or higher
- MeCab 0.993 or higher
- mecab-ipadic, mecab-jumandic, or unidic (eigher)

And you need Dlang Processing System for build if you use i386.
If you use DUB (package manager for Dlang), you can use execute.bash.

**Warning**: auther doesn't check and test under Linux. Operation in other environments is not guaranteed.
